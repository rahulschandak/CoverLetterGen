## Idea

While applying for jobs, I often edited the company name, job role, and date on my cover letter template using MS Word. This was a very tedious process when I was applying to more than 200 jobs or so. Not to forget, I'll end up missing some replacements and end up sending the cover letter to company 'A' with the some content of company 'B'. Also, I agree that every job should have a custom cover letter, but this one was a generic letter I used more often and hence felt the need for automation.

This project is an approach to reduce the number of errors I make while replacing common content on the cover letter and to save the time I spent editing those MS Word docs for my cover letter. It's a very naively coded project because my primary concern was to use the UI as soon as possible (and for one particular purpose only). Just so you know, this is not an AI-based cover letter generator.
